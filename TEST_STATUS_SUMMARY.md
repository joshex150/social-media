## Issues Identified

### 1. Test-Implementation Mismatch
The subscription tests expect UI elements that aren't implemented in the actual component:
- Upgrade prompt banner
- Activity limit reached banner
- Create Activity button
- Daily suggestions card
- Error message display

### 2. Font Loading Issues
Some tests fail due to Expo font loading errors in the test environment, though this doesn't affect core functionality.

### 3. Navigation Mocking
Integration tests need better navigation mocking for full app flow testing.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Subscription Component**: Update the subscription screen to include the missing UI elements that tests expect
2. **Update Test Mocks**: Align test expectations with actual implementation
3. **Run Remaining Tests**: Execute activity, chat, feedback, and integration tests

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Better Test Setup**: Improve font mocking and navigation mocking
2. **Component Completeness**: Ensure all components match test expectations
3. **Error Handling**: Add proper error states and user feedback

## Current Status: 65% Tests Passing (13/20)

The core dashboard functionality is working perfectly with all tests passing. The subscription functionality is partially implemented but needs UI elements to match test expectations.
